## About Me

GRADUATING FROM NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY WITH A B.S. IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, I STARTED OFF MY INTEREST IN PROGRAMMING BY TEACHING MYSELF VBA TO SCRIPT MACROS AND APPLICATIONS WHEN I WAS WORKING AT AN ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING FIRM AND A QUANTITATIVE TRADING HEDGE FUND. THE MACROS THAT I BUILT FOR THE ENGINEERING FIRM SAVED THEM NEARLY 200 HOURS OF DATA ENTRY PER WEEK AND THE APPLICATION I BUILT FOR THE QUANTITATIVE TRADING HEDGE FUND IS STILL BEING USED GLOBALLY BY THE SUPPORT STAFF. AFTER REALIZING THAT CODING IS WHAT I LOVE, I ATTENDED APP ACADEMY, A 1000-HOUR IMMERSIVE FULL-STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP WITH A <3% ACCEPTANCE RATE.
