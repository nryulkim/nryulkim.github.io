## About Me

  Graduating from Northwestern University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, I started off my interest in programming by teaching myself VBA to script macros and applications when I was working at an environmental engineering firm and a quantitative trading hedge fund.

  The macros that I built for the engineering firm saved them nearly 200 hours of data entry per week and the application I built for the quantitative trading hedge fund is still being used globally by the support staff.

  After realizing that coding is what I love, I attended App Academy, a 1000-hour immersive full-stack web development bootcamp with a <3% acceptance rate.
